# Hello there!

Experienced Software Engineer with over 6 years of expertise in crafting robust, scalable, and secure applications. I specialize in applying advanced methodologies, including Agent-Driven Development and Test-Driven Development (TDD), using TypeScript, React, and PHP.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Software Engineering (Cybersecurity Specialization) at San José State University (SJSU) to deepen my knowledge in secure and scalable system design.

I have a proven track record of impact, including architecting a hospitality platform migration delivered in two months, resulting in an 80% reduction in manual effort for our sales team. I also led the development of a store credit system using collaborative, agentic programming, which accelerated the time-to-market by 30%.

My background includes building full-stack solutions with AWS and Kubernetes, optimizing database queries, and improving test suite efficiency to achieve significant cost savings. I am passionate about tackling complex problems and using innovative technologies to deliver high-quality, impactful software.

Skills:

 ❖ Languages & Frameworks: JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Go, React, Jest, Yii, PHPUnit
 
 ❖ Cloud & DevOps: Amazon Web Services (AWS), CircleCI, GitHub
